1) **Installing VSCode**

First go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and install it. Click on the button that is most appropriate (Mac or Windows).  When you open the application, it should read Visual Studio Code, new file, open, or clone git repository. In my case, I already had a file open which is why the screenshot looks like that. 

2) **Remotely Connecting**

To remotely connect to a computer, you are going to find your username on the sdacs website. Once you change your password, input "ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu" and the zz should be replaced with what your username consists of. Enter yes and then put in your password. 

3) **Trying Some Commands**

Here, I used the ls function which is supposed to list what files you have in that specific directory. perl5 posted meaning that is one of the files.
